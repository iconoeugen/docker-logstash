# Settings file in YAML
#
# Settings can be specified either in hierarchical form, e.g.:
#
#   pipeline:
#     batch:
#       size: 125
#       delay: 5
#
# Or as flat keys:
#
#   pipeline.batch.size: 125
#   pipeline.batch.delay: 5
#
# ------------  Node identity ------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
# node.name: test
#
# If omitted the node name will default to the machine's host name
#
# ------------ Data path ------------------
#
# Which directory should be used by logstash and its plugins
# for any persistent needs. Defaults to LOGSTASH_HOME/data
#
path.data: ${LS_DATA_DIR}
#
# ------------ Pipeline Settings --------------
#
# Set the number of workers that will, in parallel, execute the filters+outputs
# stage of the pipeline.
#
# This defaults to the number of the host's CPU cores.
#
pipeline.workers: ${PIPELINE_WORKERS}
#
# How many workers should be used per output plugin instance
#
pipeline.output.workers: ${PIPELINE_OUTPUT_WORKERS}
#
# How many events to retrieve from inputs before sending to filters+workers
#
pipeline.batch.size: ${PIPELINE_BATCH_SIZE}
#
# How long to wait before dispatching an undersized batch to filters+workers
# Value is in milliseconds.
#
pipeline.batch.delay: ${PIPELINE_BATCH_DELAY}
#
# Force Logstash to exit during shutdown even if there are still inflight
# events in memory. By default, logstash will refuse to quit until all
# received events have been pushed to the outputs.
#
# WARNING: enabling this can lead to data loss during shutdown
#
pipeline.unsafe_shutdown: ${PIPELINE_UNSAFE_SHUTDOWN}
#
# ------------ Pipeline Configuration Settings --------------
#
# Where to fetch the pipeline configuration for the main pipeline
#
path.config: /etc/logstash/conf.d
#
# Pipeline configuration string for the main pipeline
#
# config.string:
#
# At startup, test if the configuration is valid and exit (dry run)
#
config.test_and_exit: ${CONFIG_TEST_AND_EXIT}
#
# Periodically check if the configuration has changed and reload the pipeline
# This can also be triggered manually through the SIGHUP signal
#
config.reload.automatic: ${CONFIG_RELOAD_AUTOMATIC}
#
# How often to check if the pipeline configuration has changed (in seconds)
#
config.reload.interval: ${CONFIG_RELOAD_INTERVAL}
#
# Show fully compiled configuration as debug log message
# NOTE: --log.level must be 'debug'
#
config.debug: ${CONFIG_DEBUG}
#
# ------------ Queuing Settings --------------
#
# Internal queuing model, "memory" for legacy in-memory based queuing and
# "persisted" for disk-based acked queueing. Defaults is memory
#
queue.type: ${QUEUE_TYPE}
#
# If using queue.type: persisted, the directory path where the data files will be stored.
# Default is path.data/queue
#
# path.queue:
#
# If using queue.type: persisted, the page data files size. The queue data consists of
# append-only data files separated into pages. Default is 250mb
#
queue.page_capacity: ${QUEUE_PAGA_CAPACITY}
#
# If using queue.type: persisted, the maximum number of unread events in the queue.
# Default is 0 (unlimited)
#
queue.max_events: ${QUEUE_MAX_EVENTS}
#
# If using queue.type: persisted, the total capacity of the queue in number of bytes.
# If you would like more unacked events to be buffered in Logstash, you can increase the
# capacity using this setting. Please make sure your disk drive has capacity greater than
# the size specified here. If both max_bytes and max_events are specified, Logstash will pick
# whichever criteria is reached first
# Default is 1024mb or 1gb
#
queue.max_bytes: ${QUEUE_MAX_BYTES}
#
# If using queue.type: persisted, the maximum number of acked events before forcing a checkpoint
# Default is 1024, 0 for unlimited
#
queue.checkpoint.acks: ${QUEUE_CHECKPOINT_ACKS}
#
# If using queue.type: persisted, the maximum number of written events before forcing a checkpoint
# Default is 1024, 0 for unlimited
#
queue.checkpoint.writes: ${QUEUE_CHECKPOINT_WRITES}
#
# If using queue.type: persisted, the interval in milliseconds when a checkpoint is forced on the head page
# Default is 1000, 0 for no periodic checkpoint.
#
queue.checkpoint.interval: ${QUEUE_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL}
#
# ------------ Metrics Settings --------------
#
# Bind address for the metrics REST endpoint
#
http.host: ${HTTP_HOST}
#
# Bind port for the metrics REST endpoint, this option also accept a range
# (9600-9700) and logstash will pick up the first available ports.
#
http.port: ${HTTP_PORT}
#
# ------------ Debugging Settings --------------
#
# Options for log.level:
#   * fatal
#   * error
#   * warn
#   * info (default)
#   * debug
#   * trace
#
log.level: ${LOG_LEVEL}
path.logs: ${LS_LOGS_DIR}
#
# ------------ Other Settings --------------
#
# Where to find custom plugins
# path.plugins: []

#
# ---------------------------------- X-Pack -----------------------------------
#
#
# Set to false to disable X-Pack monitoring. Configure in both elasticsearch.yml and kibana.yml.
#
xpack.monitoring.enabled: ${XPACK_MONITORING_ENABLED}
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url: ${XPACK_MONITORING_ELASTICSEARCH_URL}
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username: ${XPACK_MONITORING_ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME}
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: ${XPACK_MONITORING_ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD}
